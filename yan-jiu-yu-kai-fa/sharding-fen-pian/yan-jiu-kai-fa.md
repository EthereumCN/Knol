# 执行情况

Implementations under development include:

* [sharding implementers call](https://github.com/ethresearch/eth2.0-pm)
* [sharding utils](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding): has the sharding manager contract and interfaces.
* py-evm/Trinity: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm), [Github: sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding), [Github: Trinity](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/trinity). Trinity is the planned/under development EVM that will run a node and network.
* Geth-sharding: [Github](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/prysmaticlabs/geth-sharding), [website](https://prysmaticlabs.com/).
* [Drops of Diamond](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/diamond_drops): using the fast, safe and concurrent [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) programming language.
* Nimbus \([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14u65XVNLOd83cq3t7wNC9UPweZ6kPWvmXwRTWWn0diQ/edit#)\): an implementation in Nim which compiles to C, and would be good for integrating with [Hera](https://github.com/ewasm/hera), an eWASM implementation in C++. Developed by Status, they are looking to support mobile phones.
* [Artemis](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/artemis) [PegaSys](https://twitter.com/PegasysEng) [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/): Java Implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain
* [Lodestar](https://github.com/ChainSafeSystems/lodestar_chain) [ChainSafe Systems](https://chainsafe.io/): an implementation of the beacon chain in JavaScript.
* [Shasper](https://github.com/paritytech/shasper) [Parity Technologies](https://parity.io/): Shasper beacon chain implementation using the Substrate framework.
