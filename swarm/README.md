## Swarm and web3

[Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/15/swarm-alpha-public-pilot-basics-swarm/), a native base layer service of the ethereum web3 stack that aims to provide a decentralized and redundant store for dapp code, user data, blockchain and state data. Swarm sets out to provide various base layer services for web3, including node-to-node messaging, media streaming, decentralised database services and scalable state-channel infrastructure for decentralised service economies.

**Fault Tolerant**

Cross-node replication and erasure coding ensures data availability

**Censorship Resistant**

Data is stored throughout the network without vulnerable central hubs

**DDoS Resistant**

Decentralised peer-to-peer networks mitigate DDoS attack vectors

**Zero Downtime**

Redundancy ensures continued data delivery even when individual nodes go offline

**Self-sustaining**

Built-in incentive system ensures the network's economic viability

## Built for Ethereum

From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from the world wide web. In the background, the difference is that content is hosted on a peer-to-peer storage network instead of individual servers. This peer-to-peer network is self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer-to-peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment. Swarm is designed to deeply integrate with the devp2p multiprotocol network layer of Ethereum as well as with the Ethereum blockchain for domain name resolution, service payments and content availability insurance.
