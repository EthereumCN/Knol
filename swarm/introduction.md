Swarm is a censorship resistant, permissionless, decentralised storage and communication infrastructure.

This base-layer infrastructure provides these services by contributing resources to each other. These contributions are accurately accounted for on a peer to peer basis, allowing nodes to trade resource for resource, but offering monetary compensation to nodes consuming less than they serve.

Swarm is using existing Smart-Contract platforms \(e.g. Ethereum\) to implement the financial incentivisation.

### 1.1. Implementations of Swarm

| Client-Name | Programming Language | Maintained by | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Swarm Go-Client | golang | Swarm Core-Team |  |
| Swarm Nim-Client | nim | Status.im | Development is planned to start Q1 2020 |

### 1.2. Public Swarm Networks

| Network ID | Network Name | Type of Network | Maintained by | Gateways |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Network ID \#4 | EF-Test-Network | Pubic Test-Network | Swarm Core-Team / EF Dev OPS | [https://swarm-gateways.net](https://swarm-gateways.net/) |

The Ethereum Foundation operates a Swarm testnet that can be used to test out functionality in a similar manner to the Ethereum testnetwork. Everyone can join the network by running the Swarm client.

### 1.3. Development status

Uploaded content is **not guaranteed to persist on the testnet** until storage insurance is implemented \(see [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ethersphere/projects/8) for more details\). All participating nodes should consider participation a voluntary service with no formal obligation whatsoever and should be expected to delete content at their will. Therefore, users should **under no circumstances regard Swarm as safe storage** until the incentive system is functional.[Next ](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html)[ Previous](https://swarm-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
