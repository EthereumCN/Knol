# 介绍



## Introduction

Py-EVM is a new implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\) written in Python.

If none of this makes sense to you yet we recommend to checkout the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) website as well as a [higher level description](http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/what-is-ethereum.html) of the Ethereum project.

### Goals

The main focus is to enrich the Ethereum ecosystem with a Python implementation that:

* Supports Ethereum 1.0 as well as 2.0 / Serenity
* Is well documented
* Is easy to understand
* Has clear APIs
* Runs fast and resource friendly
* Is highly flexible to support:
  * Public chains
  * Private chains
  * Consortium chains
  * Advanced research
