# 研究开发



Implementations under development include:

* [sharding implementers call](https://github.com/ethresearch/eth2.0-pm)
* py-evm/Trinity: [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ethereum/py-evm), [Github: sharding](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/sharding), [Github: Trinity](https://github.com/ethereum/py-evm/tree/trinity). Trinity is the planned/under development EVM that will run a node and network.
* [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm): Ethereum 2.0 client implemented in go. [Gitter](https://gitter.im/prysmaticlabs/prysm), [website](https://prysmaticlabs.com/).
* [Drops of Diamond](https://github.com/Drops-of-Diamond/diamond_drops): using the fast, safe and concurrent [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) programming language, implemented deprecated specifications, it's lead developer @jamesray1 has been working on rust-libp2p, particularly gossipsub, an extensible pubsub messaging protocol.
* [Lighthouse](https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse): implemented the first version of the shasper spec, while work is still underway while waiting for the latest spec to finalize.
* Nimbus \([doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14u65XVNLOd83cq3t7wNC9UPweZ6kPWvmXwRTWWn0diQ/edit#)\): an implementation in Nim which compiles to C, and would be good for integrating with [Hera](https://github.com/ewasm/hera), an eWASM implementation in C++. Developed by Status, they are looking to support mobile phones.
* [PegaSys](https://twitter.com/PegasysEng) \(ConsenSys\): developing a full client that is targeted for enterprise users.
* deprecated: [sharding utils](https://github.com/ethereum/sharding): has the sharding manager contract and interfaces.
