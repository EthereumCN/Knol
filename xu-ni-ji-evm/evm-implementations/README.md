* [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)
  * A popular Ethereum client with its own EVM implementation \([core/vm](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/core/vm) directory\)
* [Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/parity) in Rust
  * Another popular Ethereum client with its own EVM implementation \([ethcore](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/tree/master/ethcore) directory\)
* [cpp-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum)
  * An Ethereum client that generates the consensus test suite \([libevm/VM.cpp](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/develop/libevm/VM.cpp)\)
* [Pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum) in Python
  * A mostly deprecated client \([ethereum/vm.py](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/vm.py)\)
* [Py-EVM](https://github.com/pipermerriam/py-evm) in Python
  * A Python implementation designed to be highly configurable and modular and compliant with the Ethereum test suite, work is in progress on it to run a full node and develop sharding.
* [EthereumJ](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj) in Java
  * A client with its own EVM implementation
