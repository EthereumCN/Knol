# 以太坊基础

### Getting started

To get the basic concepts of Ethereum visit [http://ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/). For another introduction targeted for end users but also for developers and others, see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-introduction). If you want to get a deeper understanding, start by reading the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale). For a more formal review, read the [yellow paper](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) or the [Jello Paper](https://jellopaper.org/). If you are interested in being a core developer, find a project such as [these ones](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Clients,-tools,-dapp-browsers,-wallets-and-other-projects) that interests you, and start contributing to that \(maybe pro-bono initially, until maintainers like you and decide to hire you\). If you start your own project, tell the world about it e.g. on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Peepeth](https://peepeth.com/), [Status](https://status.im/), and [Akasha](https://beta.akasha.world/) and see [https://gitcoin.co/grants/quickstart](https://gitcoin.co/grants/quickstart) and [https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/10/15/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-4/](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/10/15/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-4/). For Ethereum research and protocol architecture, visit [https://ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/) as well as [https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/R&D](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/R&D). If you are interested in developing smart contracts you can see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Programming_languages), as well as under [ÐApp Development](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%C3%90App-Development) \(which is also in the sidebar\).

### Don't get lost

If you have any question, check the [FAQS](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQS) and [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary).

There are separate wikis for some implementations, as follows:

* [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki)
* [Parity](https://paritytech.github.io/wiki/)
* [cpp-ethereum](http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/index.html)
* [pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/wiki)

### A proposal to move the content in this wiki to a Wikipedia-style wiki site

See [this issue](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/589).

### See also

* [https://en.ethereum.wiki/](https://en.ethereum.wiki/), an alternative version to this wiki. More details on that are in [this issue](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/589).
* [https://docs.ethhub.io/](https://docs.ethhub.io/), which at a quick glance, looks like a decent site worth looking into for newbies and pros to get news and info about the Ethereum sector.
