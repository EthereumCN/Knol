# EVM 编程语言

* [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity)
  * The most popular programming language for Ethereum contracts
  * [Awesome Solidity](https://github.com/bkrem/awesome-solidity)
  * The LLL compiler is also in the same repository
* [Vyper](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper)
  * A language with overflow-checking, numeric units but without unlimited loops
* [Pyramid Scheme](https://github.com/MichaelBurge/pyramid-scheme) \(experimental\)
  * A Scheme compiler into EVM that follows the [SICP compilation approach](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-35.html#%_sec_5.5)
  * [ceagle](https://github.com/MichaelBurge/ceagle) compiles C into Pyramid Scheme
* [Flint](https://github.com/franklinsch/flint)
  * A language with several security features: e.g. asset types with a restricted set of atomic operations
* [LLLL](https://github.com/mmalvarez/eth-isabelle/blob/master/example/LLLL.thy)
  * An LLL-like compiler being implemented in Isabelle/HOL
* [HAseembly-evm](https://github.com/takenobu-hs/haskell-ethereum-assembly)
  * An EVM assembly implemented as a Haskell DSL
* [Bamboo](https://github.com/pirapira/bamboo) \(experimental\)    - A language without loops but with explicit constructor invocation at the end of every call
