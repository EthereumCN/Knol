# Casper CBC

[Casper the Friendly GHOST: Correct by Construction \(CBC\)](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/CasperTFG/CasperTFG.pdf), AKA Casper CBC; for full Proof-of-Stake \(PoS\). [GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881) stands for Greediest Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree, and is a blockchain fork-choice rule protocol. PoS will be essential for the sustainability of Ethereum, drastically reducing its energy consumption while increasing scalability and performance. Resources include:
